        <h1>Html video elments</h1>

        <video width="400" controls>//use "autoplay" attribute in place of controls,video is in playing state
            <source src="mov_bbb.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="mov_bbb.ogg" type="video/ogg">

          </p>

          <p>The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

            It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
            
            The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
            
            The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.</p><br><br>
