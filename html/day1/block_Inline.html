     <!--This is the very important block level tag which plays a big role in grouping various other HTML tags and applying CSS on group of 
     elements. Even now <div> tag can be used to create webpage layout where we define different parts (Left, Right, Top etc.) of the page using 
     <div> tag. This tag does not provide any visual change on the block but this has more meaning when it is used with CSS. -->
